===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Load index.html in your favorite browser (Chrome is recommended).
2) The game should automatically initialize at Level 0.
3) Using the up, down, left and right keys, move the character across the street to the water while avoiding collision with enemy bugs.  Each time you reach the water you will progress to the next level and automatically reset to the starting position.
4) Collect gems to get extra points.  Gems appearing in the first column grant 100 extra points and one extra life.
5) Reach level 10 to win!
